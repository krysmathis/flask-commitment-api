# Commitments API

Each day we make commitments to others and ourselves. The goal of this project is to make those commitments visible and trackable.

Note: not to be confused with git commits - this is about actions you've promised to take IRL.

**MVP**:
- An API so that users can add commitments programatically to the database

- A second phase will contain scripting to retrieve commitments identified by daily Cortana emails from Outlook and populate the database

- A third phase will include the steps the user needs to interact with commitments including reporting and signing off on completed commitments

## Getting Started

**Mac OS**

Launch the init script to configure the app
```shell
    sh init.sh
```
